## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

You can use PlatformIO along with the included environments in platformio.ini or create your own.

Or you can use Arduino IDE (via the MaxDuino/MaxDuino.ino file)

## INSTALLING PREBUILT RELEASES

You can now download prebuilt releases from the github Releases page and upload them to your device
using the appropriate tools for your device (usually that's avrdude).  For example, on Arduino Nano you can
follow these instructions https://forum.arduino.cc/t/using-avrdude-to-push-sketch-to-arduino/525745
The master branch will always have a release called "latest" which is automatically rebuilt on every commit.
There will also be specific release packages whenever there is a major or minor version bump.

* V2.02 Oled driver optimizations.
* V2.01 aka "San Fermin". Fixed oled corruption and new cartoon8x16 font.
* V2.00.x New maxduino stable and tested reference version.
* V1.77.x  **SEE VERSION.H FOR MORE DETAILS**  first rolling version with automatic version numbering.
  See git commit history for changes: https://github.com/rcmolina/MaxDuino/commits/master
  See version.h (and the Menu "Version..." option) to display what version you currently have.
  V1.77 uses semantic versioning :  MAJOR.minor.patch.sha  (build is incremented for each commit, and sha corresponds to the first few characters of the github commit hash)
  e.g. 1.77.1234.ffca means this is v1.77 , patch number 1234 (based on number of changes), commit HEAD ffca

* "New MaxDuino": No version Numbers due to collaborative new contributions for the project
